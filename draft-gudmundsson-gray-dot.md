# Introduction

The IETF is a successful organization of volunteers, for over 30 years it has
provided leadership on standards for the Internet.  During that time the
organization adopted to number of changes related to size, funding, document
preparation, administration etc. This document is about addressing the issue of
maintaining the culture of the organization and provide for recognition of past
accomplishments.

The document proposes the yearly selection of few long term participants that
have been valuable contributors for a special honored status.   In the standards
world to large extent ideas spring from the younger more dynamic members and get
refined by help of the more seasoned participants. Thus over time the role
participants play in the IETF dynamic needs to evolve. Right now there are few
ways to celebrate the accomplishments of long term contributors.

# Background

The first IETF meeting was in 1983. The participants at that meeting
where all at least 20 years old and the oldest was probably in his
40's. That initial cadre, where they still participate, are now considerably
more experienced.

A typical journey thought the IETF consists of:

{: #figops title="Typical IETF Leadership Service"}

Notice in this diagram there is no role for mentoring it is assumed that
everyone will be mentoring and guiding the new participants or it falls on the
people that are more experienced and hold positions thus more work load on them.

Some long term participants want to take on more the role of guide than active
leader of new initiatives.  For that reason the IETF will establish a new role
for long term participants we call this role the "Emeritus Participant".  The
Emeriti will be issued a special gray badge dot to show they are held in esteem by
the community. The role of the Emeritus is to act as a disseminator of wisdom
and experience.  They will run the mentoring programs for new attendees, and be
sounding boards for participants for new ideas, how to overcome hurdles, who to
talk to, provide introductions, etc.

Emeriti shall not hold IETF, IAB, IAOC, liaison, nor Working Group Chair
positions, but they can be short term care takers of working groups and liaison
roles, when vacancies occur. Emeriti are encouraged to help organize and chair
Birds of a Feather sessions. Emeriti are not NomCom eligible. These restrictions
are  intended to free the Emeritus from the obligations the community
continuously seeks to place on our most competent participants.

# Selection

This section updates {{RFC7437}}.

Emeriti are selected by the NomCom for a lifetime appointment.

A call for nominations will go out after the NomCom is finished with the current
set of leadership nominations, and the selections (if any) will by announced
before that NomCom's term is finished.  

Emeriti will be inducted at the plenary of the Summer IETF.  The NomCom will
have open call for nominations each year,  from this list of nominations it will
create a short list of candidates, at this point it will unseal the list from
prior years NomCom, and create a list.

## Qualified Candidates

To be elected to the Emeritus status 3 out of the last 5 NomComs must have
selected the member. Thus the NomCom will submit the list to board of previous 4
nominating committees and ask if any of the members of their list now qualify
for Emeritus status.

Representatives of the 4 previous NomComs will confirm the selection.  At the
end term of each NomCom it will appoint one of the voting members as the holder
of the confidential list from that committee, with a second member as backup.

Nominations for Emeritus status are confidential and MUST include a detailed
rationale as why the person deserves this honor.  Sitting IESG and IAB members
are not eligible for nomination.  The Emeritus nominee MUST have been active for
at least 15 years at the time of nomination and have attended at least 30
meetings.

Before announcing the results of an Emeritus selection, the nominee is contacted
and asked to accept the honor. If nominee does not accept,  the nominee is
stricken from the list for this year.

## Initial Selection

Year #1
: 7 initial Emeriti are selected by the sitting NomCom, it selects further 5
  Emeriti for the confidential list.

Year #2

: 3 of the 5 Emeriti nominees from the prior year's list are selected if
  they are renominated. The committee is allowed to place 7 names to the future
  confidential list.

Year #3
: The committee selects up to 7 Emeritus nominees. If any candidate has been
  selected for confidential list by prior NomComs without being advanced, they
  qualify for Emeritus status.

# Emeriti Benefits

* Free IETF registration.
* Gray badge dot.
* There will be a special mailing list to contact the Emeriti. This list is
  not archived, to allow the community to contact the Emeriti with sensitive
  issues.
* The Emeritus Club will be provided as an office for the Emeriti
  to be available for discussion with members of the community. This office will
  be available to WG and design teams that would like outside
  arbitrators/guides/mentors to help them overcome issues.

# Emeriti Expectations

* Help the mentorship program, with volunteers that they train.
* Host the newcomers reception.
* Assists/Participate in design teams as observers and reviewers.
* Report at administrative plenary on the losses to the community (if any).
* Participate in safeguarding the history of the internet and bring forth
  contributions of the "behind the scenes" participants.
* Connect community members with needs to the other participants or services
  that can help them be successful.

# Courtesy to Emeriti

Participants should value spending time with Emeriti, frequently offering to pay
for them in restaurants and bars.  Offer rides to/from airports/train
stations/restaurants etc.  Ask them for guidance in a respectful manner,
thoughtfully considering their input.

# Internationalization Implications

By giving international participants access to impartial experienced guides the
hope the impact of international participants will increase.

# Security Considerations

Not applicable

# IANA Considerations:

None (Note: we could decide to do an IANA registry of Emeriti for posterity)
