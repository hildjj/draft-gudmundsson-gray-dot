1.  Introduction

   The IETF is a successful organization of volunteers, for over 30
   years it has provided leadership on standards for the Internet.
   During that time the organization adopted to number of changes
   related to size, funding, document preparation, administration etc.
   This document is about addressing the issue of maintaining the
   culture of the organization and provide for recognition of past
   accomplishments.

   The document proposes the yearly selection of few long term
   participants that have been valuable contributors for a special
   honored status.  In the standards world to large extent ideas spring
   from the younger more dynamic members and get refined by help of the
   more seasoned participants.  Thus over time the role participants
   play in the IETF dynamic needs to evolve.  Right now there are few
   ways to celebrate the accomplishments of long term contributors.

2.  Background

   The first IETF meeting was in 1983.  The participants at that meeting
   where all at least 20 years old and the oldest was probably in his
   40's.  That initial cadre, where they still participate, are now
   considerably more experienced.

   A typical journey thought the IETF consists of:

                 Figure 1: Typical IETF Leadership Service

   Notice in this diagram there is no role for mentoring it is assumed
   that everyone will be mentoring and guiding the new participants or
   it falls on the people that are more experienced and hold positions
   thus more work load on them.

   Some long term participants want to take on more the role of guide
   than active leader of new initiatives.  For that reason the IETF will
   establish a new role for long term participants we call this role the
   "Emeritus Participant".  The Emeriti will be issued a special gray
   badge dot to show they are held in esteem by the community.  The role
   of the Emeritus is to act as a disseminator of wisdom and experience.
   They will run the mentoring programs for new attendees, and be
   sounding boards for participants for new ideas, how to overcome
   hurdles, who to talk to, provide introductions, etc.

   Emeriti shall not hold IETF, IAB, IAOC, liaison, nor Working Group
   Chair positions, but they can be short term care takers of working
   groups and liaison roles, when vacancies occur.  Emeriti are
   encouraged to help organize and chair Birds of a Feather sessions.
   Emeriti are not NomCom eligible.  These restrictions are intended to
   free the Emeritus from the obligations the community continuously
   seeks to place on our most competent participants.

3.  Selection

   This section updates [RFC7437].

   Emeriti are selected by the NomCom for a lifetime appointment.

   A call for nominations will go out after the NomCom is finished with
   the current set of leadership nominations, and the selections (if
   any) will by announced before that NomCom's term is finished.

   Emeriti will be inducted at the plenary of the Summer IETF.  The
   NomCom will have open call for nominations each year, from this list
   of nominations it will create a short list of candidates, at this
   point it will unseal the list from prior years NomCom, and create a
   list.

3.1.  Qualified Candidates

   To be elected to the Emeritus status 3 out of the last 5 NomComs must
   have selected the member.  Thus the NomCom will submit the list to
   board of previous 4 nominating committees and ask if any of the
   members of their list now qualify for Emeritus status.

   Representatives of the 4 previous NomComs will confirm the selection.
   At the end term of each NomCom it will appoint one of the voting
   members as the holder of the confidential list from that committee,
   with a second member as backup.

   Nominations for Emeritus status are confidential and MUST include a
   detailed rationale as why the person deserves this honor.  Sitting
   IESG and IAB members are not eligible for nomination.  The Emeritus
   nominee MUST have been active for at least 15 years at the time of
   nomination and have attended at least 30 meetings.

   Before announcing the results of an Emeritus selection, the nominee
   is contacted and asked to accept the honor.  If nominee does not
   accept, the nominee is stricken from the list for this year.

3.2.  Initial Selection

   Year #1  7 initial Emeriti are selected by the sitting NomCom, it
      selects further 5 Emeriti for the confidential list.

   Year #2  3 of the 5 Emeriti nominees from the prior year's list are
      selected if they are renominated.  The committee is allowed to
      place 7 names to the future confidential list.

   Year #3  The committee selects up to 7 Emeritus nominees.  If any
      candidate has been selected for confidential list by prior NomComs
      without being advanced, they qualify for Emeritus status.

4.  Emeriti Benefits

   o  Free IETF registration.

   o  Gray badge dot.

   o  There will be a special mailing list to contact the Emeriti.  This
      list is not archived, to allow the community to contact the
      Emeriti with sensitive issues.

   o  The Emeritus Club will be provided as an office for the Emeriti to
      be available for discussion with members of the community.  This

      office will be available to WG and design teams that would like
      outside arbitrators/guides/mentors to help them overcome issues.

5.  Emeriti Expectations

   o  Help the mentorship program, with volunteers that they train.

   o  Host the newcomers reception.

   o  Assists/Participate in design teams as observers and reviewers.

   o  Report at administrative plenary on the losses to the community
      (if any).

   o  Participate in safeguarding the history of the internet and bring
      forth contributions of the "behind the scenes" participants.

   o  Connect community members with needs to the other participants or
      services that can help them be successful.

6.  Courtesy to Emeriti

   Participants should value spending time with Emeriti, frequently
   offering to pay for them in restaurants and bars.  Offer rides to/
   from airports/train stations/restaurants etc.  Ask them for guidance
   in a respectful manner, thoughtfully considering their input.

7.  Internationalization Implications

   By giving international participants access to impartial experienced
   guides the hope the impact of international participants will
   increase.

8.  Security Considerations

   Not applicable

9.  IANA Considerations:

   None (Note: we could decide to do an IANA registry of Emeriti for
   posterity)

10.  Normative References
